# Design Patterns Demo
Demonstrated object-oriented design patterns such as Singleton, State, Template, Composite, Proxy, Visitor, Strategy, Observer patterns. \
One can view the code for understaning the specific design pattern. \
To run the code go to the specific folder and use below mentioned command to test the code.

## For Singleton
